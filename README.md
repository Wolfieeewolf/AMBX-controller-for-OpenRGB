# OpenRGB AMBX Controller

An OpenRGB controller implementation for Philips amBX Gaming lights.

## Overview

This controller enables OpenRGB to control Philips amBX gaming peripherals, including the left/right lights and the wallwasher with its three lighting zones. The implementation supports multiple amBX units connected simultaneously.

## Features

- Full control of all 5 lights in the amBX system
- Direct per-LED color control
- Zone-based control (Side Lights and Wallwasher zones)
- Support for multiple amBX units connected simultaneously

## Requirements

- OpenRGB (latest version recommended)
- libusb (included with OpenRGB)
- **WinUSB driver** installed via Zadig (Windows only)

### Installing WinUSB Driver (Windows only)

The amBX device requires WinUSB drivers to allow libusb to communicate with it:

1. Download Zadig from [zadig.akeo.ie](https://zadig.akeo.ie/)
2. Connect your amBX device
3. Run Zadig
4. Select "Options" â†’ "List All Devices"
5. Find your Philips amBX device in the dropdown
6. Select "WinUSB" as the driver
7. Click "Install Driver" or "Replace Driver"

## Installation

1. Copy the AMBXController folder to the `Controllers` directory in your OpenRGB source code
2. Build OpenRGB with your preferred method
3. Launch OpenRGB

## Usage Notes

- The device must be connected before starting OpenRGB for reliable detection
- If you connect the device after OpenRGB is running, restart OpenRGB to detect it
- Multiple amBX units will appear as "Philips amBX", "Philips amBX 2", etc.

## Troubleshooting

- If the device isn't detected, ensure the WinUSB driver is properly installed
- If OpenRGB crashes, make sure no other software is controlling the amBX device
- If you encounter USB communication errors, try a different USB port
